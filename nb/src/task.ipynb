    "\n",
    "The heuristic described above is straightforward but can lead to numerous false positives and negatives due to its reliance on keyword matching. Common examples of incorrect classifications include:\n",
    "- \"Peanut butter\" being misclassified as non-vegan, as “butter” is incorrectly assumed to imply dairy.\n",
    "- \"eggless\" recipes being misclassified as non-vegan, due to the substring “egg.”\n",
    "- Animal-derived ingredients such as “pork” and “bacon” being incorrectly identified as vegan, as they may not be explicitly listed in the keyword set.\n",

    "## 1. Implement Diet Classifiers\n",
    "Complete the two classifier functions in the diet_classifiers.py file within this repository. Ensure your implementation correctly identifies “keto” and “vegan” meals. After implementing these functions, verify that the Flask server displays the appropriate badges (“keto” and “vegan”) next to the corresponding recipes.\n",
