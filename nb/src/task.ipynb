    "1.\t**Readability & Logic** – Clearly explain your approach, including your reasoning and any assumptions. If you relied on external resources (e.g., ingredient databases, nutrition datasets), be sure to cite them.\n",
    "2.\t**Executability** – Your code should run as is when cloned from your GitHub repository. Ensure that all paths are relative, syntax is correct, and no manual setup is required.\n",
    "3.\t**Accuracy** – Your classifiers will be evaluated against a holdout set of 20,000 recipes with verified labels. Performance will be compared to the ground truth.\n",

    "## Next steps\n",

    "\n",
    "Please make sure you join from a quiet environment and have access to a Python-ready workstation capable of running your submitted project."
